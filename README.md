I am student of Northcoders, a full stack coding bootcamp teaching a practical and industry wise curriculum. While studying, I have utilized a variety of modern tech methods, creating both a front-end and back-end for a news aggregate website. Prior to studying at Northcoders (and after graduating from Liverpool University) I worked at the National Trust at Dunham Massey in Altrincham, and began organizing music events across Manchester and Liverpool.
